# MedPal

Winner project of the [Ryerson Hackathon](https://ruhacks.com/) 2019 in Toronto.

## Concept

Make the medical pills tracking easier by using MedPal.\
It allows to have a smart assistant reminding you to take your pill periodically through SMS, allowing anyone with a phone to be able to use the service! On top of that, it implements a feature of pill recognition based on machine learning in image detection.
You can set several options such as the end of the cycle, or add a pill directly from the picture you took.
